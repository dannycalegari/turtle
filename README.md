Random turtle in the hyperbolic plane

This program generates a random walk in the hyperbolic plane performed
by a ``turtle'' (think: turtle logo) which alternates between taking a
step of some fixed length, and turning left or right (with equal probability)
through some fixed angle. The length/angle can be adjusted, and the random
seed specified (so that the effect of changing the parameters with a fixed
seed can be seen). The image can be outputted to an .eps file.
